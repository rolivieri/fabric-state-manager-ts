[![Build Status - Master](https://travis-ci.org/rolivieri/fabric-state-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rolivieri/fabric-state-manager/builds)

# fabric-state-manager

This repository contains a reusable Golang chaincode component, `RemoverCC`, for deleting the records found under a list of namespaces. Thus, this chaincode component can be used to wipe out the world state. The `RemoverCC` chaincode component exposes the following methods:

 - DeleteState - Deletes all records found under the namespaces that are passed in to the `Initialize()` method.

Though more than likely you won't be resetting the world state in a production environment, doing so in a test or staging environment or as part of a PoC application is more than common.

## Compiling and running test cases

### Platform
It is stronly recommended to use **macOS** or a **Linux** flavor (such as Ubuntu) for compiling and testing the `RemoverCC` chaincode component.

### Prerequistes
1) Before you attempt to compile and run the tests cases for `RemoverCC`, please make sure you have the necessary [pre-requisites](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/prereqs.html) on your system:

* GO programming language (v1.9.x)

2) Once you have GO installed on your system, you should download the Fabric v1.1.0 files. To do so, you can access the following URL from your browser: `https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/archive/v1.1.0.tar.gz`. As an alternative, you can execute the following command from your command line:

```
curl -O -L https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/archive/v1.1.0.tar.gz
```

After downloading the Fabric files, you should untar the archive. You can do so by executing the following command:

```
tar -xvf v1.1.0.tar.gz
```

Untarring the above file results in the creation of a folder named `fabric-1.1.0`. You should now move the contents of the `fabric-1.1.0` folder into the following folder `${GOPATH}/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric` (you may need to first create the `${GOPATH}/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric` folder).

**Note**: Unfortunately, at the time of writing, the GO languge does not have yet an official dependency manager tool. Initially, [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) was slated to become this tool but that no longer seems to be the case. Due to the lack of such a tool, the need for downloading the Fabric v1.1.0 archive, untarring it, and copying the files to the corresponding folder.

3) Finally, you'll also need to download the following assert library before proceeding with steps in the next section:

```
go get github.com/stretchr/testify/assert
```

### Steps
1) Once you have cloned this repository into your GO workspace, navigate to its root folder and execute the commands shown below to compile and test the `RemoverCC` chaincode component:

```

## How to leverage this code from your chaincode component
### Development
Please remember that Hyperledger Fabric takes into account chaincode components when partitioning the data stored in a channel. In other words, a chaincode components won't be able to read and/or delete any state that has been saved by another chaincode component on the same channel. Because of this, you cannot just deploy this code as a chaincode component and expect it to have access to the data written by another chaincode. Therefore, to leverage the code in this repository, you can follow the following steps:

1. Download this repository as a dependency:

```
$ go get github.com/rolivieri/fabric-state-manager
```

2. Import the `fabric-state-manager` package into your chaincode component:

    ```
    package main

    import (

        ...

        sm "github.com/rolivieri/fabric-state-manager"

        ...
    )
    ```

3.  Use inheritance (or composition) to extend the capabiltiies of your code by referencing the `RemoverCC` structure (which resides in the `fabric-state-manager` package you just imported) in your chaincode component:
    
    ```
    type SampleChaincodeCC struct {      

        ...

        //Using inheritance in this sample
        sm.RemoverCC

        ...    
    }
    ```

4.  From the `Init()` method in your chaincode component, invoke the `Initialize(...)` method. The invocation to the `Initialize()` method from your chaincode should pass an array of strings that contains the namespaces whose data should be deleted from the world state.  Ex:

    ```
    // Init initializes chaincode
    func (t *SampleChaincodeCC) Init(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) pb.Response {
	
        ...

        namespaces := []string{"namespace1", "namespace2", ... "namespaceN"}			
        t.Initialize(namespaces)

        ...

        return shim.Success(nil)
    }
    ```

5.  Add the `DeleteState(...)` method to the `Invoke()` method of your chaincode component.  Ex:

    ```
    // Invoke - Entry point for Invocations
    func (t *StakeholdersChaincode) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) pb.Response {
        function, args := stub.GetFunctionAndParameters()

        switch function {
            case "Function1":
                return t.Function1(stub, args)
            case "Function2":
                return t.Function2(stub, args)
            
            ...

            case "DeleteState":		
                return t.DeleteState(stub)
            
            ...
        }

        ...

    }
    ```

6.  Whenever there is the need to reset the world state, your Fabric client application should call the `DeleteState()` method which will read the namespaces provided to the `Initialize()` method; the invocation of the `DeleteState()` method will result in the deletion of all the records found under those namespaces.

### Deployment
As mentioned before, hopefully there will soon be a dependency manager tool for GO. Also, once this is available, hopefully the Hyperledger Fabric platform makes use of this tool so chaincode developers can simply specify in some form their chaincode dependencies so they can be pulled down on behalf of the developer (think of `package.json` for Node.js apps or  `Package.swift` for Swift apps). In the mean time, to deploy a chaincode component that leverages the code in this repository, you will need to perform a few manual steps.

1. Install the `govendor` tool:

```
go get -u github.com/kardianos/govendor
```

For further details, please see the govendor [documentation](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor).

2. From the root folder of your chaincode component, execute the following commands:

```
govendor init
govendor add github.com/rolivieri/fabric-state-manager

```

Please note the above assumes you have the `govendor` tool in your `PATH`.

The execution of the above commands should result in the creation of the `vendor` folder and in it you should find the `fabric-state-manager` dependency:

```
$ pwd
/Users/olivieri/go/src/my-chaincode/vendor
$ ls -la
total 8
drwxr-xr-x   4 olivieri  staff  128 Aug 30 13:21 .
drwxr-xr-x  10 olivieri  staff  320 Aug 30 13:19 ..
drwxr-xr-x   3 olivieri  staff   96 Aug 30 13:21 github.com
-rw-r--r--   1 olivieri  staff  313 Aug 30 13:21 vendor.json
$ find .
.
./vendor.json
./github.com
./github.com/rolivieri
./github.com/rolivieri/fabric-state-manager
./github.com/rolivieri/fabric-state-manager/README.md
./github.com/rolivieri/fabric-state-manager/removerCC.go
$ 
```

By following the steps above, you have effectively included in your chaincode component the `fabric-state-manager` as a dependency that will be available when your chaincode is deployed and instantiated in a Hyperledger Fabric network. For further details, please see [Managing external dependencies for chaincode written in Go](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/chaincode4ade.html#managing-external-dependencies-for-chaincode-written-in-go).
